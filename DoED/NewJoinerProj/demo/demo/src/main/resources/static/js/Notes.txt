In HTML, the class `strum_box` is applied to each individual button, while `strums_box` is applied to the parent ``
 that contains all the buttons.

Here's a breakdown of why you would use each class:

1. .strum_box: This class is applied to each button individually. You use this class to style the buttons themselves.
 For example, if you want to change the size, color, padding, or any other property of the buttons, you would target
 .strum_box.


2. .strums_box: This class is applied to the container <div> that holds all the buttons.
You use this class to style the container. For example, if you want to change the layout, spacing between buttons,
or any other property of the container, you would target .strums_box.



To make the buttons bigger, you should target the .strum_box class because you want to change the properties
of the buttons themselves. Here's an example of how you can use both classes effectively:
.strum_box {
    font-size: 20px; /* Increase the font size */
    padding: 15px 30px; /* Increase the padding */
    width: 200px; /* Set a fixed width */
    height: 60px; /* Set a fixed height */
    background-color: #4CAF50; /* Green background */
    color: white; /* White text */
    border: none; /* Remove border */
    border-radius: 5px; /* Rounded corners */
    cursor: pointer; /* Pointer cursor on hover */
}

.strum_box:hover {
    background-color: #45a049; /* Darker green on hover */
}

.strums_box {
    display: flex; /* Use flexbox for layout */
    flex-direction: column; /* Arrange buttons in a column */
    gap: 10px; /* Add space between buttons */
    align-items: center; /* Center align buttons */
}

In this example:

3. .strum_box styles the individual buttons.

4. .strums_box styles the container <div> to arrange the buttons in a column with
some space between them and center-align them.
